# ðŸš€ java-zero-to-hero

Welcome to **`java-zero-to-hero`**, a one-stop Java repository to take you from printing **Hello World!** to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Core Java**.  
This repository contains **150+ well-structured and progressively advanced Java programs**, covering all the essential concepts every Java programmer must master.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- All programs are stored in a **single branch**.
- Each program file is named using a clear and consistent naming convention:
- Programs are written in **pure Core Java** (no external libraries/frameworks).
- Each program is **self-contained**, well-commented, and beginner-friendly.

## ðŸ§  What You Will Learn

This repository is designed to guide you through a **progressive journey** of Java and DSA mastery:

### âœ… Beginner Level â€“ Java Basics
- Printing to console (`HelloWorld`)
- Data types, variables, operators
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Input/output handling
- Typecasting

### âœ… Intermediate Level â€“ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (compile-time and run-time)
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- `this` and `super` keywords
- Method and constructor overloading/overriding

### âœ… Advanced Core Java
- Exception Handling (`try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, `finally`)
- Java Arrays and Strings
- File Handling
- Wrapper Classes and Autoboxing
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Java Collections (List, Set, Map)

### âœ… DSA Fundamentals in Java
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.
- Searching Algorithms: Linear, Binary
- Recursion problems
- Stack and Queue (Array & LinkedList based)
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Traversals)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List, DFS, BFS)
- Hashing and HashMaps
- Sliding Window and Two Pointer techniques
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming basics
- Bit Manipulation
